## üí¨¬†Agenda items

- [ ]  Introduction of an emergency mechanism in the chain to prohibit certain types of transactions.
    - [ ]  Transaction Pause.
    - [ ]  Another pallet from substrate repo which is WIP. https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12092
- [ ]  zk bls solution draft for grant (design scope for Polkadot > Ethereum: another approach using bls zk, engineering scope: zk for verifying bls12-377(circom) using bn254)
    1. Ethereum2 > Darwinia EVM (solidity impl of eth2 light client, low priority)
    2. Polkadot(ed25519) > Ethereum2 (Not Planned)
    3. Polkadot(bls, planned) > Ethereum2 (using zk to optimize impl, high priority)
        1. bls curve 12-377(probably adopted by Polkadot, source? ) and bls curve 12-381 (planned by Ethereum precompile)
        2. bn254  Ôºàpairing friendly, can be used by zk solution, feasibility ready, more easyÔºâvs bls12 series (optimize, testing on testnet, could more engineering effort on circom due to different order)
        3. Solution Ready:
            1. [https://blog.succinct.xyz/post/2022/10/29/gnosis-bridge/](https://blog.succinct.xyz/post/2022/10/29/gnosis-bridge/)
            https://github.com/succinctlabs/eth-proof-of-consensus
        4. Future plan afterwards:  engineering scope: zk for verifying bls12-377(circom) using bn12-381
